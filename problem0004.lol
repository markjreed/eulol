BTW Project Euler problem 4 
BTW Find the largest palindromic 6-digit number

BTW This exploits the fact that a palindrome of the form ABCCBA
BTW is equal to A * 100000 + B * 10000 + C * 1000 + C * 100 + B * 10 + A
BTW which is    A * 100001 + B * 10010 + C * 1100
BTW which is 11(A *   9091 + B *   910 + C *  100)
