This is a set of solutions to the Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net)
problem set, written in LOLCODE (formerly at http://lolcode.com, but it's
fallen off the Internet).

WHY?!
=====

Why not?  The goal of Project Euler is to figure out the math, not the code. 
I started out solving them in one language, came back later and used a
different one, etc. I thought this would kinda fun, in the way translating
the Bible into Klingon was fun.

I admittedly have an odd idea of fun.

NOTES
=====

All of these solutions work using a slightly modified version of Justin Meza's
awesome lci interpreter (https://github.com/justinmeza/lci).  So far, I had
to modify it to use 64-bit integers in order to solve problem 3.  

Also, since Justin did such a great job with lci, these solutions are pretty
darn blazingly fast.
