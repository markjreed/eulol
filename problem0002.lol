BTW Project Euler problem 2
BTW Find the sum of all the even Fibonacci numbers below 4,000,000
HAI 1.2
I HAS A Fib1 ITZ 1
I HAS A Fib2 ITZ 1
I HAS A Total ITZ 0
IM IN YR Loop UPPIN YR Num WILE DIFFRINT Fib2 AN BIGGR OF Fib2 AN 4000000
  BOTH SAEM MOD OF Fib2 AN 2 AN 0
  O RLY?
   YA RLY
     Total R SUM OF Total AN Fib2
  OIC
  I HAS A Temp ITZ Fib1
  Fib1 R Fib2
  Fib2 R SUM OF Temp AN Fib2
IM OUTTA YR Loop
VISIBLE Total
KTHXBYE
