BTW Project Euler problem 2
BTW Find the sum of all the even Fibonacci numbers below 4,000,000
HAI 1.2
I HAS A Fib ITZ 1
I HAS A Total ITZ 0
IM IN YR Loop UPPIN YR Num WILE DIFFRINT Fib AN BIGGR OF Fib AN 4000000
  DIFFRINT Num AN 0
  O RLY?
    YA RLY
      Fib R PRODUKT OF Fib AN Num
      BOTH SAEM MOD OF Fib AN 2 AN 0
      O RLY?
        YA RLY
          Total R SUM OF Total AN Fib
      OIC
  OIC
IM OUTTA YR Loop
VISIBLE Total
KTHXBYE
